# Single Cylcle CPU
* Design a single cycle CPU based on MIPS instruction set architecture
* Implement the instructions add, sub, lw, sw, beq, ori, or
* Design CPU controller that determines control signals for each instruction opcode
* Verify CPU with testbench program that uses machine instructions to read six 32-bit 
  integers from data memory and store the sum in memory
